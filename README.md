SaladLane is a concept where salad lovers meet to share their ideas adn recipes. Though inspired by Vagans, the meetings and membership are however not limited to vegans only. Non vegan and vegetarians are welcome. There's great benefit in eating plant-based products and we aim to share our experience by organising monthly meetups. During this meetup, members are encouraged to bring prepared salad dishes and the recipes they used. There's also room for those who want to regurly eat plain salad witho



## UX

This project is for anyone who loves Salad. Owing to the busy schedules people often have, it's sometimes difficult to keep a 
a healthy diet. We don't necessarily have to spend hours in the kitchen to prepare a health dish. We can eat on the go while saving time and even money. SaladLane aims to provide members with quick and easy recipes. Members can sign up and partake in a meetup or have recipes sent to them via mail. Our site provides video tutorials tips on how to make salads.
